## Phoenix and Rails Authentication

#### Introducing Phoenix Auth APIs to a diverse ecosystem.

class: middle

## Hi! I'm Andrew.

#### I work here.

---

class: middle center

## I'm a bike commuter üö¥üèΩ

#### A while ago I built a bunch of little tools to track where I was going on my bike.

---

## Sooo many different things

#### It's kind of a mess:

* GPS track ingestion in Node and JS, Mongo
* Visualization in Ruby on Rails
* Storage in PostgreSQL
* Authentication & identity in... TBD

---

## What the app is


![overview diagram](http://g.gravizo.com/g?
  left to right direction;
  [StravaAPI];
  [Ingester];
  [CoreStorage];
  [Frontend];
  StravaAPI <-- Ingester : polls;
  Ingester --> CoreStorage : HTTP POST;
  CoreStorage --> Frontend : serves;
)

---

## I know, I'll use Elixir!

#### Idea: What if I introduced Elixir into my project as an identity service?

Responsibilities:

* Authentication
* Authorization (TBD)

## Fell in love!

---

## Desired architecture

#### Introduce an identity system, which will store the list of users and their tokens - and manage sessions, too!

  [StravaAPI];
  [Ingester];
  [CoreStorage];
  [Frontend];
  [Identity];
  Ingester --> Identity : queries;
  Frontend --> Identity : queries;
  StravaAPI <-- Ingester : polls;
  Ingester --> CoreStorage : HTTP POST;
  CoreStorage --> Frontend : serves;
)

## Step 1: Phoenix app from scratch

Played with *Ueberauth*

* Wrote a plugin: ueberauth_strava
* Wrote it inside my Elixir app, then extracted into its own hex
  package.
* Ueberauth is kind of like OmniAuth

## Demo

See: Ueberauth code

---

## Step 1, done:

At this point, the app can log you in (SSO) with Strava, and find (or
create) a user account. It also stores a token.

---

## Step 2: Research authentication

Ueberauth is closely aligned with Guardian, which pushes you to use JWT
(JSON Web Tokens) as an auth and session mechanism.

---

## JWT, briefly.

[www.jwt.io](http://www.jwt.io)

#### JSON object that stores:

* Claims (authorizations, permissions)
* Signatures, tokens
* Expiry times

#### Store it in:

Cookie? Local Storage?

---

## Step 2, findings:

Hm, that might not be for me. Why not?

* Session expirations complicated
* Complex implementation
* Overkill - this is just a side project!

["Stop Using JWT For Sessions"](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/)

---

## Step 3: Rails and Phoenix session sharing!

Rails and Phoenix share parallel implementations of the Rails session
serialization and deserialization code. Stored in a cookie.

--

I wrote a blog post on this: [Rails, Meet Phoenix](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2016/07/06/rails-meet-phoenix-add-phoenix-to-your-rails-ecosystem-with-session-sharing/)

---

## How to do this:

#### Set up Phoenix and Rails with the same:

* `SECRET_KEY`
* cookie name prefix
* cookie salt (encrypted, and signing salt)

Then add a plug library `PlugRailsCookieSessionStore`

---

### Tada!

---

## Finally: open a Users API

Internal apps can access it to get a list of users and their tokens.

`GET /users`

Simple `Bearer-Token` auth, protected over SSL.

---

## Soooooo...

## Takeaways

* Get started with Elixir however you can.
* Just because it's shiny.. doesn't mean you have to use it!
